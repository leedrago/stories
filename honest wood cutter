There was a honest wood cutter in  a small village who used to visit forest every day for work.
He used to cross the river to reach for his work.
one day he slipped his axe into river unknowingly and felt very sad since it is the only tool he had to do his work.
He sat near the bank shore and started weeping about his misfortune.
Suddenly a goddess came from inside of the river and seen the woodcutter weeping at the bankside.
She wanted to test the woodcutter's honesty.
She approached him in the form of fisherwoman and asked him what was the issue?
The woodcutter explained her the entire issue in detail and told her that he wont be able to survive without his axe.
She assured him that she will search and bring back the axe from the bottom of river.
By saying this the goddess in the disguise of fisherwoman jumped into the river.
