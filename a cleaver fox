There used to be a cleaver fox in the forest.
one day it started to think deep about its future survival and came up with a plan.
Gathered all the animals in the forest and started weaving a story.
It was about the guardian of the forest and who can be the guardian.
In the starting all other animals are quite confused about the proposal.
